== Description ==
**[MobiLoud Commerce](https://www.mobiloud.com/woocommerce-mobile-app?ref=plugindesc)** turns your WooCommerce store into native iOS and Android apps. Commerce is not a free plugin, but part of our service for building and maintaining WooCommerce mobile apps. 

If you have already spoken to our team or signed up for Commerce, go ahead and install the plugin. 

If not you can either [book a demo call](www.mobiloud.com/demo) to speak to one of our app experts, or read on and learn about how we can help you to convert your WooCommerce site to mobile apps.

== What is MobiLoud? ==

Since 2013, we’ve been helping WordPress-based businesses turn their websites into iOS and Android apps. More than 1200 businesses have gone live to the App Stores with MobiLoud, including top international brands like Foreign Policy and Business Insider. 

Unlike most other WooCommerce app builder platforms, we are a full service not just a tool. We work with you to bring the apps live from the first demo call to launching on the App Store and Google Play. We also handle all ongoing updates and maintenance. 

== What is Commerce? ==

We built Commerce to give WooCommerce store owners the power to build modern, fast, fully native shopping apps in just weeks - for a fraction of the cost of traditional development.

Commerce is three things. Firstly, it’s a platform that builds iOS and Android apps optimized for eCommerce. Secondly it’s this plugin that pulls content from your WooCommerce store to the apps and gives you a simple dashboard to customize and manage them. Thirdly it's a team of experts that are always on hand to help out via email or calls, by your side to make the apps a success.  

Commerce is for any WooCommerce business that wants to build a more engaging, sticky mobile experience - and drive up conversions, LTV, and customer satisfaction as a result.

== Commerce Features ==

Commerce builds simple but powerful eCommerce apps, with the feature set needed to provide a great mobile user experience. 

* **Synced with your site** -- your Commerce apps will sync completely with your site. The apps will update instantly with any new products, updates, or changes you make in WooCommerce - so there’s nothing to add to your workflow. 
* **100% native** -- Commerce creates fully native apps, offering the best in speed, performance and user experience. 
* **Keep your cart** -- Your existing cart setup will work in the iOS and Android apps straight out of the box. 
* **Integrate your payment gateway** -- You can use your existing payment gateway so you can sell in the apps just like you do on the web. 
* **Unlimited push notifications** -- Update your customers on the status of their orders, drive them back into the apps with new offers, and send out special app-only coupons and deals. 
* **Native sharing ** -- Your customers can easily share products that they like through Whatsapp, Messenger, and other popular platforms with just the tap of a button. 
* **Analytics** -- Use Google analytics or FireBase to understand your users behavior. Track all your sales with WooCommerce, just like on the web. 

These are a few of our main features, and we’re building new ones all the time. If you want the full breakdown [book a demo!](www.mobiloud.com/demo).

== Why Build WooCommerce Mobile apps? ==

Your WooCommerce site probably works great right now - but it’s no longer enough to provide an optimal mobile experience for all of your customers. 

eCommerce is now mobile-first, and apps are playing an important role. 78% of customers would rather access a store through an app than a mobile site, and eCommerce apps also drive 3x higher conversion rates than their web counterparts. 

Push notifications are also a key reason to build apps for your WooCommerce store. With Commerce apps, you can send unlimited notifications on iOS and Android - using them to drive traffic, boost sales, and reward your app users with special offers and coupons. 

Building WooCommerce mobile apps will allow you to:

* **Build more loyalty and boost LTV** -- Your website is good for first impressions, picking up organic traffic, and the early stages of the journey. What are you doing for your core fans though? We’ve seen countless times that mobile app users are hyper-engaged. Compared to the web, eCommerce app users return 50% more often and spend 18x more time shopping per month too. 20% of customers will likely account for 8% of your sales, these are people you should build WooCommerce mobile apps for. 
* **Improve customer experience** -- Native apps deliver a more immersive and engaging mobile shopping experience than websites. Just one tap to your products, fast loading, and intuitive native navigation with no distractions is a superior UX than typing in the URL and using the clunky browser navigation to get around. Customer experience is becoming more and more crucial as a brand differentiator, perhaps that’s why cart abandonment is around 80% on the web and only 20% in eCommerce apps!
* **Boost brand visibility** -- Apps will give you a visible, lasting brand presence on the customers home screen, reminding them frequently of your existence. You’ll also have a brand presence on Google Play and the App Store - opening up the possibility of a whole new acquisition channel. 
* **Reach your customers effectively** -- Push notifications are better than email, social media, and any other customer communication channel. When you build WooCommerce mobile apps, you’ll be able to leverage push to effectively support your marketing campaigns and the customer journey. 

You can get these benefits, for a manageable monthly fee and no risk with Commerce. Sounds good? [Book a demo today!](www.mobiloud.com/demo)
